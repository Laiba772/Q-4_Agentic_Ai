# 📝 Assignment 02: Exploring OpenAI Agents SDK and Building a Calculator Agent

✅ Explored the OpenAI Agents SDK.  
✅ Implemented a simple calculator agent (`simple_agent.py`) that adds two numbers.  
   The agent accepts two numerical inputs from the user via the command line and outputs their sum.  
   It currently supports integers and floating-point numbers but does not handle invalid inputs or non-numeric values.
